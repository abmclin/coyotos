	S. Shapiro</a></b> is the managing partner of The EROS
	Group. He is the primary architect of <a
	href="http://www.eros-os.org">EROS</a>, the predecessor to
	Coyotos. Dr. Shapiro did most of the writing of the Coyotos
	specification, designed and implemented the cross-environment
	tools, and spends an inordinate amount of time handling
	administrivia for the company. He now works primarily on the
	application-level environment for Coyotos.

	W. Adams</a></b> is a partner and Senior Software Engineer
	with The EROS Group. He joins us from Sun Microsystems where
	he spent several years in their core kernel development
	group. Mr. Adams works primarily on the Coyotos kernel and
	core domains.

    <h1>Other Contributors</h1>

      <b>Eric Northup</b> contributed key ideas to the EROS secure
      window manager and worked out the real-time capability
      invalidation and garbage collection techniques that are being
      used in the Coyotos implementation.

      <b>Mark Miller</b> has now returned to Hewlett Packard
      Laboratories, but has consulted on many aspects of the Coyotos
      and BitC designs. Check out some of Mark's current work on the
      <a href="http://www.erights.org">E Programming Language</a>.

      <b>Swaroop Sridhar</b> and <b>M. Scott Doerrie</b> are working
      on the BitC project at Johns Hopkins University.  Swaroop has
      worked on high-performance dynamic translation technology, and
      currently is in charge of the BitC compiler and semantics for
      the Coyotos project. Scott is our verification expert. Among
      other things, Scott has the unusual distinction of having
      identified and corrected a bug in the EROS specification from an
      attempt to formalize the design constraints, and originated an
      alternative approach that does not yield anomolous behavior.</p>
