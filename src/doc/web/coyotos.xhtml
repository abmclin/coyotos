    <h1 class="title">The Coyotos Secure Operating System</h1>
    <p>
      Coyotos is a secure, microkernel-based operating system that
      builds on the ideas and experiences of the <a
	href="http://www.eros-os.org">EROS</a> project. Much of the
      code developed for EROS will migrate directly to Coyotos.

	site now makes use of SVG images. If your browser supports
	SVG, or you have an SVG plugin installed, you should see an
	SVG logo to the left of this paragraph. Recent versions of
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari browsers
	include support for SVG.  If you are a Fedora Core user, or
	your Linux distribution ships an older version of Mozilla or
	Firefox, installing Adobe's <a
	href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/">plugin</a>
	will allow you to view these images. Fedora Core 5 will
	include a newer version of the Firefox browser that has
	built-in support for SVG.

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      The Coyotos
      project has several objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>Correct some of the shortcomings of the earlier EROS
	  design.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Demonstrate that an atomic kernel design scales
	  <em>up</em> as well as down. We are planning to bring up
	  versions of Coyotos on large-scale multiprocessors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Provide an efficient linux compatibility environment for
	  use as a transitional runtime system, so that we can
	  explore adapting applications to a more secure API
	  foundation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>(Eventually) Construct the kernel and key utilities in a
	  new systems programming language (<a
	  href="http://www.bitc-lang.org">BitC</a>) with a well-defined,
	  mechanically-specified semantics. This will allow us to
	  formally verify security and correctness properties of the
	  system and its key utilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Develop the proving technology necessary to do useful
	  verification about a project of this sort.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Target Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Coyotos is being developed on AMD-64 and Pentium platforms. A
      port is also underway to recent Coldfire processors. Once we
      have a baseline kernel working, we would welcome help getting it
      running on PowerPC and ARM processors as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It is <em>far</em> too early to speculate about release
	dates.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
      At present, the main mailing list for the coyotos project is <a
      href="http://www.coyotos.org/mailman/listinfo/coyotos-dev">coyotos-dev</a>.
      This list is intended primarily for developers and
      architects. When a release exists, we will add a user-oriented
      list as well.
