 * APs are halted in APIC INIT state. We need to issue a Startup IPI for the APs.
 * The Startup IPI conveys an 8-bit vector specified by the software that issues
 * the IPI to the APs. This vector provides the upper 8 bits of a 20-bit physical
 * address. Therefore, the AP startup code must reside in the lower 1Mbyte of
 * physical memoryâ€”with the entry point at offset 0 on that particular page.
 * 
 * In response to the Startup IPI, the APs start executing at the
 * specified location in 16-bit real mode. This AP startup code must
 * set up protections on each processor as determined by the SL or
 * SK. It must also set GIF to re-enable interrupts, and restore the
 * pre-SKINIT system context (as directed by the SL or SK executing on
 * the BSP), before resuming normal system operation.  The SL must
 * guarantee the integrity of the AP startup sequence, for example by
 * including the startup code in the hashed SL image and setting up
 * DEV protection for it before copying it to the desired area.  The
 * AP startup code does not need to (and should not) execute SKINIT.
